    <h1>Trump Advances Border Wall Agenda</h1>
    <div class="article-text">
      President Trump hosted a meeting at the White House today with leaders from both parties in order to address an impasse in negotiations over new immigration policy. Trump has previously endorsed protections for “dreamers”, but little progress has been made in reaching a deal. Trump emphasized the importance of building his signature border wall as part of any immigration package.

      Trump has repeatedly stressed the importance of the border wall in securing the border in order to prevent both illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He has held steady in repeating his campaign promise that Mexico will pay for the border wall.

      <div class="comment-text">For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.</div>
