<h3>Debrief:</h3>

Thank you for participating in our study. While we told you in the task description very generally that we were studying commenting behavior and algorithms, we are actually studying how design of webpages influences how people write comments.  More specifically, we are investigating whether the design elements that different users saw positively impacted the tone of their subsequent comment on the text snippet. For example, did users who interacted with a cute picture post a more positive comment subsequently.
<br>
<br>
While we do not currently have an algorithm that will be tested on these comments, we hope to develop an algorithm or related approach from this data. In this study you were in the control condition- there was no experimental intervention in your task. All participants were shown the same brief passage from the article, and all users were shown the same set of comments; these comments were not generated by other participants but rather by the research team. This was done to ensure that participants each had the same starting point.
<br>
<br>
With this information, we hope to better design webpages to effectively curate, display, or respond to comments to facilitate useful and productive discussion. We believe that, if successful, this research will contribute to better-designed interfaces for text chats and comment threads. Since we were exploring how these design elements might impact user commenting, and we wanted participants' natural responses, we did not tell you the full study purpose up front.
<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about this study, or wish to withdraw from the study, please contact the principal investigator, Joseph Seering at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes avenue, Pittsburgh PA, 15213, or alternatively at jseering@andrew.cmu.edu.
<br>
<br>
Finally, we request that you not discuss this study with anyone else who is currently participating or might participate at a future point in time. We will not be able to examine rigorously the effect of these design elements on participants who know beforehand the full purpose of this study.
<br>
<br>
Thank you!
